# Project Charter

## Project Title

Information Technology Room Tenant System

## Project Purpose

The purpose of the app is to streamline the process of borrowing rooms in JTI building for events, such as seminars, workshops, etc. The app will be used by the staff and faculty of JTI to manage the rooms and the events. The app will also be used by the students to book the rooms for their events. This app is made in hope of reducing the amount of paperwork and administrative workload being done manually.

## Project Objectives

- To create a system where the staff and faculty of JTI can manage the rooms and the events easily.
- To make it easier for students to book the rooms for their events.
- To reduce the amount of paperwork and administrative workload being done manually.
- To make the process of borrowing rooms in JTI building for events more efficient.

## Project Scope

### In Scope

- The project is a web app that can be accessed by the admins of the inventory using a web browser.
- The app should have a basic authentication feature to ensure that only the authorized users can access the app.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the inventory, such as adding, removing, and updating the room and event data.
- The admin and student should be able to see the list of rooms and events.
- The app should be able to provide a way for the admins to manage the users, such as adding, removing, and updating the users.
- The app should provide a way for students to borrow a room from the list. Each room can only be borrowed for a certain amount of time.
- The admins should be able to see the history of the room borrowings.
- The app should never give an invalid state such as the start of the borrowing time is after the end of the borrowing time.

### Out of Scope

- Integration with other systems, such as the university's student information system for Single Sign-On (SSO).
